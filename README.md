# Robotic-Spider - Final Year Project 

This repository showcases my final year engineering project, the “Robotic Spider,” designed to imitate the locomotion and agility of a real spider using a multi-legged robotic platform. The primary objective of this project is to explore advanced mobility solutions for robots in uneven, complex, or hazardous terrains where traditional wheeled robots struggle. The robotic spider includes a lightweight mechanical structure, servo-controlled legs, and an embedded control system programmed for stable and adaptive movement. It is capable of walking, turning, and climbing minor obstacles through precise coordination of its leg actuators. The project integrates electronics, control algorithms, embedded programming, and mechanical design to demonstrate how biomimicry can enhance robotic motion. This repository includes circuit diagrams, 3D models, gait algorithms, and firmware code, along with documentation explaining the design approach, implementation, and testing results. The aim of this work is to contribute toward modern robotics where safety, maneuverability, and terrain flexibility are crucial, making such robots suitable for search and rescue, surveillance, and industrial inspection applications.
